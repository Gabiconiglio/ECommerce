            <strong>Description: </strong> My name is Gabriel and I am a student
            studying Programming Technology at the National Technological
            University of CÃ³rdoba.
            <br />I am currently in my second year and have gained experience in
            Java, SQL, HTML, CSS and React.
            <br />I consider myself a proactive person, curious and committed to
            my studies.
            <br />I value punctuality and formality in all my activities, as I
            believe they are fundamental aspects for academic and professional
            success.
            <br />I am excited to continue learning and contribute to the world
            of programming with my skills and knowledge.
